                We believe in all the prophecies in the Bible; likewise we
                believe that we can be given the gift of prophecy by the
                inspiration of the Holy Spirit – I Cor. 14:29. Despise not
                prophesying – I Thess. 5:20. But any prophecy that is against
                the Bible is rejected.

                Above all, whatever is not Bible teaching should be ignored
                entirely by all members. If there be found any member disobeying
                these teachings he may be disciplined privately, but if any
                backslider would not admit discipline and restitute his way, he
                may be disciplined openly as it is written in Matt. 18:15-18, So
                that truth might be established by the witness of two or three
                according to the Word of God. Rebuke them that sinned before all
                that others also may fear – I Tim. 5:20; I Cor. 5:1-13; II Cor.

                The Word of God teaches us that monogamy has been the order
                since the beginning of the Law of Christ. Divorce is permissible
                only when a life partner has committed adultery. Even then,

                It is instituted by our Lord Jesus Christ shortly before His
                death. He commanded all Christians to gather together regularly
                to share the bread and wine till He comes back again – Luke
                22:17-20; Matt. 26:26-29; Mark 14:22-25; I Cor. 10:18, 21; Acts

              <p className="">
                The born-again souls are called the Church of God – Eph. 1:22;
                Col. 1:1-18; Eph 3:10; 5:24-29. The assembly of the believers,
                the sanctified souls in Christ Jesus, Those who we call the Holy
                people of God – I Cor. 1:2; Acts 14:23; Phil. 4:15; Acts 13:28.
                Therefore all that God has called to gather together in a place
                and fed with the Word of God – Acts 2:41-47; They accept Christ
                as the head of the Church. They gather from time to time to
                worship God in truth and Spirit to share the bread and eat.
                Their major assignment is to spread the Gospel of Christ to all
                Nations – Matt. 28:19.

              <p className="text-sm font-bold">The Dedication or Separation</p>
              <p className="">
                Dedication is very important for the children of God for the
                Lord is Holy – John 17:19; I Peter 1:15-16. If we want god to be
                our Father, we must separate and dedicate ourselves unto God –
                II Cor. 6:17-18. God called us unto Holiness – I Thess. 4:7;
                Rom. 12:1-2.

              <p className="">
                The dedicated Christian would avoid foolish talking or jesting,
                Eph. 5:4. He or she would not wear clothing of the opposite sex,
                Deut. 22:5. Marriage would be esteemed honorable in all respects
                in the life of the dedicated Christian, and he or she would be a
                hearer as well as a doer of the Word of God at all times.

                We believe that a brother who sleeps in the Lord is with Christ
                already – Phil. 1:21-23; I Cor. 5:1-9. Paul said that it is
                better to come out of this flesh and be with the Lord forever in
                our Heavenly home. Further still he emphasizes that ” But I
                would not have you to be ignorant brethren concerning them which
                are asleep that ye sorrow not even as there which have no hope”
                I Thess. 4:13-18. Therefore all members should separate
                themselves form the things of this world in worshiping the dead
                by which we become idolaters – Deut 14:1.

              <p className="">
                We experience daily the resurrection of the Spirit, all the
                born-again souls who are passed from death to life – Eph. 6:14;
                Rom 6:11; John 5:20. As this body is dissolved, immediately we
                are entering into our Heavenly Home or house not made with hands
                eternal in the Heavens – I Cor. 5:1-8 There is resurrection of
                the Body. Jesus taught us plainly that the buried body will be
                raised up from the tomb at the last day Job 5:28-29. Paul also
                explained this to us – Acts 24:15; I Cor. 15:22, 42-44; Phil.
                3:21; Dan. 12:2. Only Holy people will be at the resurrection
                those who belong to Jesus when He appears; but the sinners shall
                resurrect in hell, a place where people whose names are not
