        THE POTENCY OF GODLY SACRIFICE

      <blockquote className="border-l-4 border-blue-600 pl-4 italic text-gray-700 mb-6">
        "Thou therefore endure hardness, as a good soldier of Jesus Christ. No man that warreth entangleth himself with the affairs of this life; that he may please him who hath chosen him to be a soldier." 
        <br />
        <span className="font-semibold">(2 Timothy 2:3-4 KJV)</span>
      </blockquote>

      <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-6">
        Sacrifice is a major pathway to the topmost in life. Sacrifice is readiness to die in order to live. It may be painful, but the pain determines your ultimate gain in the future.
        There are things you cannot get without sacrifice. God does not give everything freely, except for general or common grace which everyone enjoys. You need to pay a certain price to enjoy extra or special grace.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">What Does Sacrifice Mean?</h2>
      <ul className="list-disc pl-6 text-lg text-gray-700 mb-6">
        <li>The act of giving up something highly valued for the sake of something greater.</li>
        <li>Going beyond your best.</li>
        <li>Deadly commitment.</li>
        <li>Denying yourself of certain pleasures.</li>
        <li>Giving up something valuable now to gain something greater in the future.</li>
      </ul>

      <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-6">
        God usually responds to sacrifice with speed. The place of sacrifice is usually God‚Äôs choice. Wherever sacrifice is offered, God is attracted.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">
        If Your Service or Worship is Not Painful, You Cannot Receive a Gainful Reward
      </h2>
      <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-6">
        For you to understand the principle of sacrifice, it must cost you something. You must lay down something. Many people have sacrificed their very lives for Christ. 
        Paul declared in <span className="font-semibold">Philippians 1:21</span>: 
        <blockquote className="border-l-4 border-blue-600 pl-4 italic text-gray-700 my-4">
          "For to me, to live is Christ, and to die is gain."
        </blockquote>
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">
        The Greater the Sacrifice, the Greater the Power Released
      </h2>
      <blockquote className="border-l-4 border-blue-600 pl-4 italic text-gray-700 mb-6">
        "The king of Moab took 700 men to help him. He offered his crown prince. Great anger was released against Israel and they withdrew from him." 
        <br />
        <span className="font-semibold">(2 Kings 3:26-27)</span>
      </blockquote>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">Types of Sacrifice</h2>

      <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">1. Sacrifice of Fasting and Prayer</h3>
      <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-6">
        Fasting and prayer signify our desire and hunger to seek God. Through them, we develop a passion for God that surpasses everything else.
        <br />
        <span className="font-semibold">(Matthew 17:21) "However, this kind does not go out except by prayer and fasting."</span>
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">2. Sacrifice of Diligence</h3>
      <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-6">
        It takes diligence to realize your potential and sacrifice to maximize it. Hard work elevates a person.
        <ul className="list-disc pl-6 text-lg text-gray-700 mt-2">
          <li>Diligence leads to promotion (Proverbs 22:29).</li>
          <li>Diligence sustains leadership (Proverbs 12:24).</li>
          <li>Diligence helps escape poverty (Proverbs 24:30-34).</li>
        </ul>
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">3. Sacrifice of Giving</h3>
      <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-6">
        Giving proves your love and devotion to God. It shows your reliance on Him. Abraham gave Isaac, and God gave him nations.
        <br />
        <span className="font-semibold">(Psalm 126:5) "Those who sow in tears shall reap in joy."</span>
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">4. Sacrifice of Praise</h3>
      <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-6">
        Praise and worship remove room for negativity and remind us of God‚Äôs faithfulness. 
        <blockquote className="border-l-4 border-blue-600 pl-4 italic text-gray-700 my-4">
          "Bless the Lord, O my soul, and forget not all his benefits, who forgives all your iniquity, who heals all your diseases, who redeems your life from the pit, who crowns you with steadfast love and mercy." 
          <br />
          <span className="font-semibold">(Psalm 103:2-4)</span>
        </blockquote>
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">Conclusion</h2>
      <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-6">
        Sacrifice may be tearful, but it leads to fearful lifting. Our sacrifice to God must be excellent, valuable, and qualitative.
        <br />
        <span className="font-semibold">(Hebrews 11:4) "By faith Abel offered unto God a more excellent sacrifice than Cain..."</span>
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">Let Your Sacrifice Not Be Corruptible</h2>
      <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-6">
        Sacrifice or service given to God with grumbling and murmuring is not pleasing to Him. Serve well in your church, attend consistently, and avoid eye service.
      </p>

        üôå Let your sacrifice be pure and acceptable unto God! üôå
