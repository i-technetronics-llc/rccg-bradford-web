        DIVINE PREFERENCE: YOU WILL BE PREFERRED

      <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-6">
        Beloved, I like to congratulate you for being part of the living in this new month and indeed our month of <strong>DIVINE PREFERENCE</strong>.

      {/* What is Divine Preference? */}
      <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">What is Divine Preference?</h2>
      <ul className="list-disc pl-6 text-lg text-gray-700 mb-6">
        <li>Divine preference makes a man the choice in the midst of the qualified.</li>
        <li>Divine preference is a greater liking for one among many alternatives.</li>
        <li>Divine preference is to be singled out for honor and uncommon favor among the crowd.</li>
      </ul>

      <p className="text-lg font-semibold text-blue-600 mb-6">
        I pray for you wherever you go from this month and beyond, may you be divinely preferred among others in Jesus' name.
      </p>

      {/* Biblical Example: Joseph‚Äôs Life */}
      <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">Biblical Example: Joseph‚Äôs Life</h2>
      <blockquote className="border-l-4 border-blue-600 pl-4 italic text-gray-700 mb-6">
        ‚ÄúNow Israel loved Joseph more than all his children because he was the son of his old age: and he made him a coat of many colors.‚Äù 
        <br />
        <span className="font-semibold">(Genesis 37:3)</span>
      </blockquote>

      <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-6">
        Jacob had ten sons before Joseph was eventually born; he even went on to have one more son (Benjamin) after having Joseph. He had twelve sons in all, but in the end, Joseph was favored above the rest of the sons. In the midst of twelve sons, Joseph was the most loved. If it was about loving the youngest son, Jacob should have loved Benjamin most, but he still loved Joseph the most. <strong>Joseph was preferred above others.</strong>
      </p>

      {/* Prophetic Decrees */}
      <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">Beloved, I Decree You Will Be Preferred</h2>
      <ul className="list-disc pl-6 text-lg text-gray-700 mb-6">
        <li>Despite the crowd of competitors around you, you will be the preferred one.</li>
        <li>Despite being in the midst of people who came ahead of you, you will be preferred.</li>
        <li>Despite being among those who may even have come later than you, you will still be preferred.</li>
        <li>Despite not being the one who should be rightfully chosen, God will give you the favor of being preferred.</li>
      </ul>

      <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-6">
        Joseph was preferred, not because there were no competitors, but despite the presence of competitors and rivals.
      </p>

      <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-6">
        By reason of the prophetic word of God to us this month:
      </p>

      <ul className="list-disc pl-6 text-lg text-gray-700 mb-6">
        <li>Your rivals will still be there and you will be preferred.</li>
        <li>Your competitors will still be there and you will be preferred.</li>
        <li>Your colleagues will still be there and you will be chosen and preferred ahead of them.</li>
        <li>Others will join you in jostling for opportunities, but you will be chosen.</li>
        <li>Others will run the same race with you, but in the end, you will come out tops.</li>
      </ul>

      <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-6">
        Joseph did not do anything special before he was preferred above others; it was not about efforts; it was all by grace. Your efforts may not give it to you, but grace will bring it to you. You may not have the advantages that others have, you may not know the people they know, you may not tick all the boxes that they have ticked, but you will still be the preferred one.
      </p>

      <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-6">
        Focus on God and forget about whosoever is ahead of you or indeed whosoever is the latest in town. When the Almighty is involved, you will be preferred.
      </p>
